# Brain Tumor Classification using a Fine-Tuned SegFormer Model

This project uses a pre-trained SegFormer model, fine-tuned on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle to classify MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.

## Results
The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 98% on the unseen test set.
